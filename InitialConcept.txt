EasyParse will be a replacement for current parsing libraries like System.Commandline and CLP
The main focus will be on the user facing API and user definitions where the tool will streamline the userexperience
as much as possible
EP will also aim to overcome the issue of some PLibs of very vague errors.
EP will pin point exactly if and here something was wrong with potential improvement suggestions

As to how the args will be defined, not decided yet.
for definiton of the class and the args, i will probably take inspiration from CLP since it has pretty good definitions.
error handling will be a huge focus with potential suggestions along the way if mistakes were made
there will be some kind of an export function, smth like EasyParse.ExportDefaultConfig(), which will create a cs file with 
default class EasyParser and some discrete options and verbs containing string,int,float,bool etc, this file will also have a 
section which will describe how to use this class(will incl summary comments as well)
